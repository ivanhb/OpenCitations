    "I have modified/removed some extra and redundant values specified inside the configuration file of the browser interface. I made this, since I am writing a documentation that will guide the users to the correct usage of the configuration file, by defining the suitable keys for the applications needed.\n",
    "I started reading and installing the RASH Framework locally to test it, this tool is very useful in case we decided to write down our works in a RASH format.\n",

    "I have discussed with Silvio the structure of the paper we are going to submit to SAVE-SD 2018 (https://save-sd.github.io/2018/index.html). We will build our paper with a focus on the search tool. I will write down a first draft starting from today.\n",
    "I have also discussed a possible evaluation of our work with one of our DASPLAB members: Andrea Nuzzolese. The idea is to try the search interface on the triplestore he can provide us.\n",

    "Friday 12/1/2018:\n",
    "I have finished writing a documentation (guide) for the configuration file of the search interface. This represent a first draft and I am planning to integrate some schemes and tables in the documentation to make it more comprehensive (https://github.com/ivanhb/search/tree/master/doc).\n",
    "I have finished writing the “Related works” section after reading and testing other tools which integrate a searching interface on a SPARQL endpoint. I have found 5 different tools: Scholia, BioCarian, DisGeNET, neXtProt, and Visual SPARQL Builder (VSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Monday 15/1/2018:\n",
    "I finished writing the introduction and the section that discuss the tool with both the architecture and configuration aspects. I have also written a large part of the evaluation section and getting it ready to be fully accomplished once all the tests have been done, we will divide this section in two main evaluation approaches: tool reuse and its Empirical evaluation. The usability test that we will actuate is the Discount Usability Test.\n",
    "I am planning to finish writing this first paper draft tomorrow and take a second look to the parts already written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuesday 16/1/2018:\n",
    "I have finished writing the first draft of the paper, and refining it after some additional readings. Some of the figures already used in the paper had some errors so I did some adjustments and re-uploaded them in the paper (specially the activity diagram). The .odt of the paper ‘paper(rash-in-odt).odt’ is stored in this git repository at (paper/) along with the images used in it.\n",
    "I have used the Wikidata as a possible example for the tool reuse. So the configuration file was set accordingly and I used some query examples discussed in the Wikidata website. The test worked fine so this could be a possible example to list in the paper. I am planning to test also scholarlydata as another example, but its server was down during all the day, I will try it tomorrow.\n",

    "There is another section we need to add to the search tool: the advanced search interface. We will use this interface when we know exactly what are we looking for, for instance when we want to retrieve all documents that have a specific author. The idea is to create a scheme where we can select a specific category from our category-set (e.g: we can select “document”) and according to this we show all the possible options (inputs) a user can perform in order to retrieve a results in “document” type. These options are represented by the rules that we have defined inside the configuration file, so in case we want “documents”, the interface will list all the possible rules that retrieve “documents”. For example we can retrieve a “document” with the rule “doi” that expects its DOI identifier in the searching box. This will make the advanced searching interface flexible for any configuration.\n",
    "Note that the advanced search is yet another javascript module, since we would like to keep this option available in the whole tool package when integrated in other systems. I have started and finished developing the Advanced Search section, users will have this default interface when clicking on the “Search” button from the navigation menu. Here we have a screenshot of how the interface will look like:\n",

    "I still need to fix some small issues and then this part will be ready to be integrated in the OpenCitations website. To upload the new files we still extract them from the search git in https://github.com/ivanhb/search/.\n",

    "Thursday 18/1/2018:\n",
    "Together with Silvio we have discussed the Advanced Search I have worked on yesterday. We need to enable the possibility to formulate a complex query with several rule entries and some logic operators to connect them (AND,OR), for instance we can search for documents that have ‘title’ equal to X and year-of-publication equal to Y. We need to add this feature in our future work.\n",
    "I have fixed an issue related to the variables replace inside the SPARQL query. Previously there was two types of variable defined according to the input type, instead now we have only a [[VAR]] tag which we can replace with any value. The different value types will be handled inside the SPARQL query (for example: with a BIND).\n",
    "I have modified the configuration file for the wikidata case. Now the tool captures the DOI and ORCID inputs and execute the corresponding queries on wikidata to retrieve Documents and Authors respectively.\n",
    "Since new modification have been applied I have modified also the .odt file of the paper.\n",

    "I was trying to fix the problems David noticed us.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have added the possibility to search for br resources (e.g: “/br/3962641”) through adding a new rule entry inside the configuration file.\n",
    "Some searching didn’t work correctly because sometimes even an additional white space not noticed while typing inside the search box might cause problems for the system. For instance “10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000361 ” (with a white space at the end) will not give any result. I have fixed this issue.\n",
    "I have changed the wording \"Searching in the corpus…” to \"Searching the OpenCitations Corpus…”.\n",
    "I will try fix other things before asking Silvio to upload this version to the website. In addition I have applied other modifications to the paper, including the new tool name suggested by David, OSCAR (Open Citations Rdf Search Application).\n",
    "\n",
    "Monday 22/1/2018:\n",
    "Together with Silvio we discussed the problems/issues David noticed, and the strategies I have adopted to try fix them. Some additional adjustments have been taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for a specific resource is possible with any textual format that ends with br/, for instance: /br/1, br/1, corpus/br/1, all work and retrieve the resource. This is also applied to the authors ra/ resources.\n",
    "The textual input of the search will remain inside the input-box even after the search terminates.\n",
    "There is the possibility to abort the current search in case it takes too much time.\n",
    "A free text search will be applied by taking in consideration all terms.\n",
    "A new button inside the interface will allow users to Export and download the data of the table in csv format.\n",
    "I will try test locally all the new features added before asking Silvio to upload this new version.\n",
    "In addition we have also discussed the evaluation section of the paper and how to proceed in defining the usability tests. Starting from tomorrow I will write a first draft of our usability test on a google doc.\n",

    "I am preparing the evaluation test four tool, and I have started writing and preparing some visual schemes to add on the intro. After uploading the new version of the tool, some new issues/extra-tasks need to be added. Therefore I spend the rest of the day developing these parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The exported .csv file is now generated correctly, with empty spaces for null fields.\n",
    "A new “None” option is available in the sort box, the results in the table will not be ordered.\n",
    "The order of the rows in the table follow the order of the results given by SPARQL. In our case SPARQL ordered the set of results based on the relevancy score of the textual search. In case we apply any sort option to the table for a specific field (e.g: “year”), rows with the same year will be ordered according to the relevancy score.\n",
    "I have uploaded this version on the “search” repository. Tomorrow I will continue preparing the evaluation test\n",
    "\n",
    "Wednesday 24/1/2018:\n",
    "While discussing with Silvio today on how to handle the slow elaboration of the searching operations for single authors names. e.g: “Shotton”. We figured out a new solution: The idea is to first execute a rule that will treat the query as it is a last name of an author if the SPARQL execution of this rule doesn’t retrieve any result we move on to the next rule which accepts our query and execute it. This way we give priority to the rules and accept the first one that retrieves results. For instance: we write “Shotton”, then we look on the set of our rules and execute the first rule which accepts such query (free-text), in our case “author name” and execute it, we have some results (the documents with “Shotton” as author) so we don’t move forward to execute other rules. I have almost finished writing the usability test on a shared google doc with Silvio. We will move its contents to esurv and create the survey test once we agree on it. The tasks to execute using the tool I have defined are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1\n",
    "Search for a document with a Digital object identifier (DOI) equal to “10.1002/cncr.28414”.\n",
    "Write the title of the document obtained here: ____\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2\n",
    "Search for an author with an ORCID equal to “0000-0001-5506-523X”. Write the author name obtained here: ____\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3\n",
    "Search for documents which contain the keywords “machine learning” in their title, and sort the results obtained according to the year of publication in a descendent order. Write the “Corpus ID” value of the first row in the table of results: ____\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 4\n",
    "Starting from the results obtained after Task 3, keep in the table of results only the documents that have as one of their authors “Michael I. Jordan”. Write the number of rows (results) you have in the table: ____\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 5\n",
    "Look for the 10 most cited documents published in 2015 and 2016 which talk about “Clinical Review”. Export and download the results obtained in the table. Copy and paste the content of the CSV file downloaded here:____\n",
    "\n",
    "Thursday 25/1/2018:\n",
    "After giving some tests to the new version of OSCAR I have developed yesterday: the rules are executed in a sequential mode by giving a priority according to their position in the array. I started thinking and preparing the configuration file for the advanced search mode. The idea to accomplish this is to create a macro rule structure for each different category and to concat other rules in SPARQL according to the logical connections between them (e.g: and, or). For instance: The category “document” will have a macro rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT ?iri ?doi ?title … Where{  \n",
    "      [[RULE]]  \n",
    "}GROUP BY … \n",
    "In this case [[RULE]] could be the textual SPARQL query of 1 rule or a complex one with the concatenation of more rules together. I have finished developing this part, but still needs some work to be ready for Advanced Searching operations. At the end of the day I moved again to the preparation of the usability test, specially writing possible background questions to profile the testers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friday 26/1/2018:\n",
    "I am developing all the parts needed to fully define the advanced search. In order to connect multiple rules together with logical operators (and,or), we need to define the policies to apply once we have an expression with multiple operations. For instance, if our complex rule is: A and B or C and D, the tool will first analyze the and operators and apply them, so the first step results are:\n",
    "[A,B] or [C,D]. Now we execute the “or” operator, to translate this in SPARQL, this will be equal to connecting the two rules with a “union”. The final result will be: {[A,B]} union {[C,D]}.\n",
    "I have successfully developed this method, next I will add new elements in the already developed Advanced Search interface to test this new procedure.\n",
    "I dedicated the rest of the day correcting/modifying the OSCAR usability questionnaire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monday 29/1/2018:\n",
    "Together with Silvio we have finalized the usability test of OSCAR and send it to the participants. Hopefully we will get our answers tomorrow in the evening. We will modify the current version of OSCAR once we are done with the tests. I have readapted OSCAR also for ScholaryData and WikiData for DOIs, ORCIDs, and free textual searches.\n",
    "Next I moved forward developing the “Advanced Search” procedures, and other issues of OSCAR, the most notable:\n",
    "\n",
    "The links in the table will open new tabs\n",
    "The name of the values in the filter section could be represented differently by specifying another field of the SPARQL result-set. For instance: the authors values representation in the filter section have the following structure “[[FamilyName]], [[FirstName]]”. This value is generated from the SPARQL query, and extracted from its result-set.\n",
    "Some adaptions in the configuration file\n",
    "I have applied a MIT license for the OSCAR repository\n",
    "Tuesday 30/1/2018:\n",
    "We discussed and changed the activity diagram of OSCAR inside the paper. And then I moved forward on developing the advanced search of OSCAR. Today I focused on the interface behavior and layout (since I have already developed the model previously). There are still additional things to do and fix in it.\n",
    "Here we have a screenshot of the current interface status:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Wednesday 31/1/2018:\n",
    "I have almost completed the advanced search interface of OSCAR. Now it’s correctly connected with the advanced model behavior and the “and” “or” rules seems to work fine. An additional logical connector I will try to add is the “and not”, which is not yet supported in the current model. The current Interface works for both categories: Documents, Authors.\n",
    "A user can add a new entry and define a new constraint to its search along with the boolean operation that connects it with the previous value:\n"
