It defines a possible approach to remodel the JSON data results retrieved when calling a SPARQL endpoint, the new format removes redundant information and compact the output in a more readable form. In our case (for both LUCINDA and OSCAR) this operation is somehow made in an implicit way after getting the results from the SPARQL endpoint, however it is an adhoc approach and does not collapse the redundant information of the original JSON.  \n",

We will follow the same strategy adopted on LUCINDA and OSCAR. A new configuration file containing all the parameters needed. I will define more properly in the next days more details on this new module (specially after consulting Silvio). Right now I am using [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) as external library for building such graphs."
