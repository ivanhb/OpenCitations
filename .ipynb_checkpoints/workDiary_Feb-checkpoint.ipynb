The SPARQL queries inside the configuration file must be enclosed in a “{}” and while using the advanced search since it combines different rule queries, it’s important to avoid having similar variable names in different rules. For instance: if I use *?lit bds:search '[[VAR]]' .* inside the query of a specific rule and I try to combine it (for example with “and” connector) with another rule which also uses *?lit*, this will create conflicts in the final SPARQL query to execute.  \n",

For instance: **search?text=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004754&rule=doi&bc_1=and&text=machine+learning&rule=any_text** .
