# OpenCitations
OpenCitations is a scholarly infrastructure organization dedicated to open scholarship and the publication of open bibliographic and citation data by the use of Semantic Web (Linked Data) technologies, and engaged in advocacy for semantic publishing and open citations. It provides the OpenCitations Data Model and the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies for encoding scholarly bibliographic and citation data in RDF, and open software of generic applicability for searching, browsing and providing APIs over RDF triplestores.

I worked as a **Research fellow** for this project from: **Nov 2018 to Nov 2019**. I am currently honoured to be still actively part of it.
My main contribution was regarding the creation of new additional querying and visual interfaces for the RDF datasets handled by OpenCitations. The main two projects developed are: [OSCAR](https://github.com/opencitations/oscar) and [LUCINDA](https://github.com/opencitations/lucinda).
