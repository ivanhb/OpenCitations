# OpenCitations
The main work of OpenCitations is the creation and current expansion of the Open Citations Corpus (OCC), an open repository of scholarly citation data made available under a Creative Commons public domain dedication, which provides in RDF accurate citation information (bibliographic references) harvested from the scholarly literature. 
I am creating new additional components and interfaces, mainly related to data-visulaization, to integrate inside the current project .
